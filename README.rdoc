1. am i defining the relationship correctly between :posts and :comments resources?

2. unable to create comments to add to posts.  I'm getting an ArgumentError related to the form I'm using.

  <%= form_for @comment do |f| %>
    ...

    first argument in form cannot be nil or empty

  cannot figure that out or go around it to work on other functions.
